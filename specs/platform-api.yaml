        Each valid shipment object will automatically trigger the calculation of all available rates. Depending on your shipment data, there may be none, one or multiple rates.

        By default, the calculated Rates will return the price in two currencies under the amount and amount_local keys, respectively. The amount key will contain the price of a rate expressed in the currency that is used in the country from which parcel originates, and the amount_local key will contain the price expressed in the currency that is used in the country the parcel is shipped to. You can request rates with prices expressed in a different currency by adding the desired currency code in the end of the resource URL. The full list of supported currencies along with their codes can be viewed on [open exchange rates](http://openexchangerates.org/api/currencies.json).

        Note: re-requesting the rates with a different currency code will re-queue the shipment (i.e. set the Shipment's status to QUEUED) and the converted currency rates will only be available when the Shipment's status is set to SUCCESS.
