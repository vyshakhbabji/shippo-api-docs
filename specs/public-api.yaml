      <p style="text-align: center; background-color: #F2F3F4;">
        </br>First-time users and those looking for specific integration tutorials,<br>
        <a href="https://goshippo.com/docs/intro">see our full API documentation and guides.</a></br></br>
      </p>

      <h3>API Resources</h3>
      All API URLs listed in this documentation are relative to <b>https://api.goshippo.com/</b>. For example, the 
      `/addresses/` resource is reachable at `https://api.goshippo.com/addresses/`.

      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      The API requires Shippo's token HTTP Authentication with your Shippo token (live or test). In order to authenticate 
      properly, please put `Authorization: ShippoToken <token>` in your header. You can find your token on the 
      <a href="https://goshippo.com/user/apikeys/">Shippo API settings page</a>.
    
      For more information about authentication and test mode, 
      <a href="https://goshippo.com/docs/auth">please visit our Authentication guide</a>.
    
      The API is available via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) only. All requests to the Shippo API must use TLS version 1.2 or higher.

      <h3>Request & Response Data</h3>
      Request data is passed to the API by <b>POSTing JSON objects</b> with the appropriate key/value-pairs to the respective 
      resource. The documentation for each API resource contains more details on the values accepted by a given resource.

      Response data also formatted as JSON object. You can specify how many results per page are to be returned. For instance, 
      `/rates/?results=25` will return up to 25 results.

      <h3>REST & Disposable Objects</h3>
      The Shippo API is built around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST principles</a>. 
      Use POST requests to create objects, GET requests to retrieve objects, and PUT requests to update objects.

      Only the Carrier Accounts object can be updated via PUT requests. All other objects such as Addresses, Parcels, 
      Shipments, Rates, Transactions, Refunds, Customs Items, and Customs Declarations are disposable. This means that 
      once you have created an object, you cannot change it. Instead, create a new one with the desired values.

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ParcelExtra"/>
  - name: Shipments
    description: |-
      The heart of the Shippo API, a shipment is made up of "to" and "from" addresses and the parcel to be shipped. 
      Once created, a shipment object can be used to retrieve shipping rates and purchase a shipping label.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Shipment"/>
      
      # Shipment Extras
      The following values are supported for the `extra` field of the shipment object.

  - name: Rates
    description: |-
      A rate is an available service of a shipping provider for a given shipment, typically including the price and 
      transit time.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Rate"/>
  - name: Transactions
    x-displayName: Transactions (shipping labels)
    description: |-
      A transaction is the purchase of a shipping label from a shipping provider for a specific service.

  - name: Customs Items
    description: |-
      Customs items are distinct items in your international shipment parcel.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CustomsItem"/>
  - name: Customs Declarations
    description: |-
      Customs declarations are relevant information, including one or multiple customs items, you need to provide for 
      customs clearance for your international shipments.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CustomsDeclaration"/>
  - name: Refunds
    description: |-
      Refunds are reimbursements for successfully created but unused shipping labels or other charges.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Refund"/>
  - name: Manifests
    description: |-
      Manifests are close-outs of shipping labels of a certain day. Some carriers require manifests to properly process 
      the shipments.

  - name: Tracking Status
    description: |-
      <p style="text-align: center; background-color: #F2F3F4;"></br>
      If you purchased your shipping label through Shippo, you can also get all the tracking details of your Shipment 
      from the <a href="#tag/Transactions">Transaction</a> object.
      </br></br></p>
      Tracking Status objects are used to track shipments.
      
      When using your <a href="https://goshippo.com/docs/auth">Test</a> token for tracking, you need to use Shippo's 
      predefined tokens for testing different tracking statuses. You can find more information in our 
      <a href="https://goshippo.com/docs/tracking#test-mode">Tracking tutorial</a> on how to do this, and what the 
      payloads look like.      
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Track"/>
  - name: Batches
    description: |-
      The batch endpoint allows you to create and purchase many shipments in one API call. After creating the batch, 
      retrieve the batch to verify that all shipments are valid. You can add and remove shipments after the batch has 
      been created. When all shipments are valid you can purchase the batch and retrieve the shipping labels.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Batch"/>
      
      # Batch Shipment
      The batch shipment object is a wrapper around a Shipment object, which include shipment-specific information 
      for batch processing.
      
      Note: batch shipments can only be created on the Batch endpoint, either when creating a Batch object or by through 
      the `/batches/{BATCH_OBJECT_ID}/add_shipments endpoint`
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/BatchShipment"/>

  - name: Pickups
    description: |-
      Shippo’s pickups endpoint allows you to schedule pickups with USPS and DHL Express for eligible shipments that 
      you have already created.

  - name: Service Groups
    description: |-
      A service group represents a set of service levels that can be grouped together to organize Rates at Checkout 
      shipping options.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ServiceGroup"/>
  - name: Carrier Parcel Templates
    description: |-
      A carrier parcel template represents a package used for shipping that has preset dimensions defined by a carrier. 
      Some examples of a carrier parcel template include USPS Flat Rate Box and Fedex Small Pak. If the shipment is 
      using a carrier parcel template, the rates returned may be limited to the carrier that provides the box. User 
      parcel templates can be created using a carrier parcel template, where the dimensions will be copied in but the 
      weight can be configured.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/CarrierParcelTemplateStruct"/>
  - name: User Parcel Templates
    description: |-
      A user parcel template represents a package used for shipping that has preset dimensions and attributes defined 
      by the user. They are useful for capturing attributes of parcel-types you frequently use for shipping, allowing 
      them to be defined once and then used for many shipments. These parcel templates can also be used for live rates.

      User parcel templates can be created using a carrier parcel template, where the dimensions will be copied from 
      the Carrier presets, but the weight can be configured by the user.
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/UserParcelTemplate"/>
  - name: Rates at Checkout
    description: |-
      Rates at Checkout is a feature that allows merchants to set up curated shipping options for customers in the 
      checkout flow based on data in the shopping cart. The request must include the to address and item information. 
      Optional fields are the from address and package information. If the optional fields are not included, the 
      service will use the default address and/or package configured for Rates at Checkout. The response will be a 
      list of shipping options based on the Service Group configuration
      (see <a href="#tag/Service-Groups">Service Group configuration</a> for details).
      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/LiveRate"/>

    description: <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Carriers"/>
  - name: Service Levels
    description: <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ServiceLevelEnumSet"/>
  - name: Parcel Templates
    description: |-
      A predefined package used by one or multiple carriers.  See below for all available values and the corresponding tokens. 
      When a template is given, the parcel dimensions do not have to be sent, the dimensions below will instead be used. 
      The parcel weight is not affected by the use of a template.

      description: |-
        Each valid shipment object will automatically trigger the calculation of all available rates. 
        Depending on your shipment data, there may be none, one or multiple rates.

        By default, the calculated Rates will return the price in two currencies under the amount and amount_local keys, 
        respectively. The amount key will contain the price of a rate expressed in the currency that is used in the country 
        from which parcel originates, and the amount_local key will contain the price expressed in the currency that is used 
        in the country the parcel is shipped to. You can request rates with prices expressed in a different currency by adding 
        the desired currency code in the end of the resource URL. The full list of supported currencies along with their codes 
        can be viewed on [open exchange rates](http://openexchangerates.org/api/currencies.json).

        Note: re-requesting the rates with a different currency code will re-queue the shipment (i.e. set the Shipment's 
        status to QUEUED) and the converted currency rates will only be available when the Shipment's status is set to SUCCESS.

        plus the weight fields (**weight** and **weight_unit**). Otherwise, omit
